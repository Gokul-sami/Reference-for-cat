/* The Cascading Order in CSS is a set of rules that determine 
which style will be applied to an element when multiple styles are conflicting. */

/* The term “cascading” refers to the way that styles are inherited 
and applied to elements in a web page. */

/* More specific styles take precedence over more general styles. */

/* Three main cascading methods are:
- Specificity
- Inheritance
- Order of declaration */

/* Cascade and the closely-related concept of specificity are mechanisms 
that control which rule applies when there is such a conflict. */
