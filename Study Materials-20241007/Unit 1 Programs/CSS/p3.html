        body {

        span {
            color: black;

<body>
    <p>As the body has been set to have a color of blue this is inherited 
        through the descendants.</p>
    <p>We can change the color by targeting the element with a selector, 
        such as this <span>span</span>.</p>

<!-- Some properties do not inherit â€” 
for example, if you set a width of 50% on an element, 
all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width. -->
